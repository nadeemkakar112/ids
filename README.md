## Fetching Data From APi
In data science, fetching data from APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is a common practice to obtain real-time or up-to-date data from various sources. APIs provide a standardized way for different systems to communicate with each other, allowing data retrieval and exchange between different applications or services.

### Identify the API: 
Determine which API provides the data you need. Many websites, services, and platforms offer APIs that allow developers and data scientists to access their data programmatically.

### Authentication: 
Some APIs require authentication to access their data. This can be done using API keys, access tokens, or other forms of authentication methods. You might need to sign up for an account on the API provider's website to obtain the necessary credentials.

### API Documentation: 
Refer to the API documentation to understand the endpoints, parameters, and data format required for making API requests. The documentation typically provides examples of how to make requests using different programming languages, including Python, which is commonly used in data science.

### API Request:
Use Python (or any other programming language) and libraries like requests to make HTTP requests to the API's endpoints. The request can be for specific data, such as weather information, financial data, social media posts, etc.

### Data Processing: 
After receiving the data from the API, you might need to process it to extract relevant information or convert it into a suitable format for analysis. Libraries like Pandas are often used for data manipulation and cleaning.

### Data Analysis:
Once you have the data in the desired format, you can perform data analysis, visualization, and modeling using various data science tools and techniques.

### Examples of APIs commonly used in data science include:

• Financial data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance API)
• Social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API, Reddit API)
• Weather data APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API)
• Public data APIs (e.g., World Bank API, COVID-19 data APIs)

# Week 4 (Data Cleaning and Pre Processing)
In this week I learn about Pivot Table, Scales, Merging and Groupby
## Pivot Table
A pivot table is a powerful data summarization and analysis tool commonly used in data analysis and business intelligence. It allows users to reorganize and aggregate data from a large dataset, providing a concise and structured view of the information. Pivot tables enable quick insights into patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, helping users make informed decisions.
In a pivot table, users can select specific columns from the original dataset to act as rows, columns, values, or filters, defining how the data should be organized and displayed. The pivot table then automatically groups and calculates data based on the specified criteria, aggregating the values as needed. This dynamic arrangement enables users to explore data from different angles and easily drill down into details.
With its flexibility and ease of use, pivot tables have become an essential tool for data analysts, business analysts, and decision-makers, enabling them to transform raw data into meaningful and actionable insights.
### Example of Pivot Table
import pandas as pd


data = {
    'Date': ['2023-07-01', '2023-07-01', '2023-07-02', '2023-07-02', '2023-07-03'],
    'Product': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'],
    'Sales': [100, 150, 120, 200, 80]
}


df = pd.DataFrame(data)


pivot_table = df.pivot_table(index='Date', columns='Product', values='Sales', aggfunc='sum', fill_value=0)

print(pivot_table)

### Output
Product         A    B
Date                   
2023-07-01    100  150
2023-07-02    120  200
2023-07-03     80    0

## Scales:
Scales, in the context of data visualization and data analysis, refer to the transformation of raw data into a visually meaningful representation. They play a crucial role in accurately communicating information through visualizations. Scales help to map data values to appropriate visual properties such as position, size, color, or shape. There are different types of scales used based on the nature of the data being visualized. Common scales include linear scales for continuous data, ordinal scales for ordered categorical data, and nominal scales for non-ordered categorical data. By selecting the appropriate scales, data scientists and visualization experts can create insightful and effective visualizations that facilitate better understanding and interpretation of complex datasets. Understanding scales is essential in the data visualization process to ensure that visual representations accurately and meaningfully convey the underlying information.

## Merge
Merge is a fundamental operation in data manipulation that combines data from multiple datasets based on specified common columns or keys. It is widely used in data analysis and data integration tasks to consolidate information from different sources. Merging enables data scientists to bring together related data, allowing them to perform comprehensive analyses and gain insights from diverse datasets.

In Python, the Pandas library provides powerful merge functionality with the merge() function. The function offers different types of joins, such as inner join, outer join, left join, and right join, to control how data is combined. 
### Example of Merging
### Code
import pandas as pd

data1 = {
    'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 22, 28]
}

data2 = {
    'ID': [3, 4, 5, 6],
    'City': ['New York', 'Chicago', 'Los Angeles', 'San Francisco'],
    'Salary': [50000, 60000, 55000, 70000]
}


df1 = pd.DataFrame(data1)
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data2)


merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='inner')

print(merged_df)

### Output
   ID     Name  Age           City  Salary
0   3  Charlie   22    Los Angeles   50000
1   4    David   28        Chicago   60000

## Groupby
GroupBy is a powerful data manipulation technique used in data analysis to split data into groups based on specific criteria, apply functions to each group, and combine the results into a structured format. It allows data scientists to perform operations on subsets of data, enabling deeper insights and analysis. The GroupBy process involves three steps: splitting the data into groups based on a chosen key or keys, applying a function or transformation to each group, and then combining the results into a new data structure. GroupBy is commonly used in conjunction with aggregate functions, such as sum, mean, count, or custom functions, to obtain summary statistics or perform complex data transformations. This functionality is often found in libraries like Pandas, which provide powerful GroupBy capabilities for handling data in Python. By utilizing GroupBy effectively, data scientists can efficiently analyze and interpret large datasets, gaining valuable insights from structured data subsets.
### Example of Groupby
### Code
import pandas as pd


data = {
    'Category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'],
    'Value': [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]
}


df = pd.DataFrame(data)


grouped_df = df.groupby('Category')['Value'].mean()

print(grouped_df)
### Output
Category
A    18.333333
B    22.500000
Name: Value, dtype: float64


# Week 5 (Exploratory Data Analysis)
In this week i learn how to understand the data and also learn about univariate and bivariate 

## Basic Understanding of Data
To undestand your data you have to ask 7 questions
1. How big is the data?
2. How does the data look like?
3.  What is the data type of cols?
4.  Are there any missing values?
5.   How does the data look mathematically?
6.   Are there duplicate values?
7.   How is the correlation between cols?
 These are 7 Questions by the help which you can understand your data

## Univariate
In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), univariate analysis is a fundamental technique used to understand and analyze individual variables in isolation. It involves examining each variable or feature in the dataset separately to gain insights into its distribution, central tendency, spread, and other statistical properties. Univariate analysis is particularly useful for detecting outliers, understanding the range of values within a variable, and identifying patterns or trends within the data.

During univariate analysis, data scientists commonly use various graphical and numerical methods such as histograms, box plots, summary statistics (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), and frequency distributions. These techniques provide a comprehensive view of the characteristics of a single variable, which can help in making data-driven decisions and formulating hypotheses.

By performing univariate analysis in EDA, data scientists can identify potential issues with individual variables, identify the need for data preprocessing, and get a solid foundation for more advanced multivariate analysis and modeling. It is an essential step in the data exploration process, allowing practitioners to gain initial insights into the dataset's structure before delving into more complex analyses.

Overall, univariate analysis is a crucial starting point in Exploratory Data Analysis, as it provides a clear and detailed understanding of the distribution and characteristics of each variable in the dataset, leading to more informed and effective data-driven decisions.

##Bivariate
In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), bivariate analysis is a key technique used to explore the relationship between two variables in the dataset. Unlike univariate analysis, which focuses on a single variable in isolation, bivariate analysis examines the interaction between two variables to understand how they are related or correlated.

Bivariate analysis involves the use of various visual and statistical methods to investigate the dependencies and associations between two variables. Some common techniques used in bivariate analysis include scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and correlation matrices. These methods help in identifying patterns, trends, and possible connections between the variables, providing valuable insights into the underlying data structure.

By performing bivariate analysis, data scientists can answer important questions such as:

1. Does one variable have a linear relationship with another?
2. Are there any noticeable trends or patterns when two variables are plotted together?
3. Do changes in one variable affect the other variable?
4. Are there any outliers or unusual observations in the joint distribution of the two variables?
Bivariate analysis plays a critical role in identifying potential correlations and dependencies, guiding the selection of appropriate variables for predictive modeling, and providing initial evidence for potential cause-and-effect relationships. It also acts as a stepping stone towards more sophisticated multivariate analyses, where interactions among multiple variables are explored.

Overall, bivariate analysis is an essential component of Exploratory Data Analysis, as it sheds light on the relationships between pairs of variables, leading to a deeper understanding of the dataset and informing subsequent data modeling and decision-making processes.
# Week 6 (GGPLOT)
GGPLOT is a powerful data visualization package in R that allows data scientists and analysts to create high-quality and customizable graphics with ease. Developed by Hadley Wickham, ggplot2 follows the grammar of graphics, enabling users to build visualizations by specifying data, aesthetic mappings, and geometric layers. The package provides a wide range of plot types, such as scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, and more, and allows for sophisticated customization of axes, colors, themes, and labels. ggplot2 encourages a layered approach to visualization, where each layer represents a different aspect of the plot, making it easy to build complex visualizations while maintaining a clear and structured code. With its intuitive syntax and versatility, ggplot2 has become a go-to tool for data visualization in R, empowering users to communicate insights effectively and explore patterns and trends in their datasets.
# Week 7 (Data Visualization)
Data visualization is a powerful technique in data analysis and communication, aiming to represent complex information visually in a clear and intuitive manner. Through charts, graphs, plots, and other visual representations, data visualization helps data scientists and decision-makers quickly understand patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets. It allows for the identification of outliers, the comparison of multiple variables, and the exploration of large datasets efficiently. By using the right visualization techniques, data scientists can effectively communicate insights, present findings, and make data-driven decisions, enhancing the overall understanding and impact of their analyses. Data visualization plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into actionable knowledge, making it an indispensable tool for effectively conveying information in various domains, including business, research, and exploratory data analysis.
# Week 8 (Statistical Testing)
Statistical testing is a critical component of data analysis used to make objective inferences and draw conclusions from sample data about a population. It involves applying various statistical techniques to test hypotheses and assess the significance of observed differences or relationships. Common statistical tests, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, and correlation analyses, are used to compare means, proportions, variances, and associations between variables. The process involves formulating null and alternative hypotheses, selecting an appropriate test based on data type and research question, calculating test statistics, and interpreting the results in terms of p-values and confidence intervals. By conducting statistical testing, data scientists can validate assumptions, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions with confidence, thereby adding rigor and reliability to their analyses.

# Week 9 (Machine Learning)
Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. It enables machines to automatically learn and adapt through experience, making predictions or decisions based on patterns and relationships found in the data. There are three primary types of Machine Learning: supervised learning (where the algorithm learns from labeled data), unsupervised learning (where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data to find patterns), and reinforcement learning (where the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback).

The typical steps in a Machine Learning workflow include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Machine Learning has a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and autonomous vehicles. It has become an indispensable tool in various industries, driving advancements and innovations by leveraging the power of data to make intelligent and data-driven decisions. 

# Week 10 (Regression Analysis)
## Basic Linear Regression
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and widely used regression techniques in statistics and machine learning. It is a method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The equation takes the form:

y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + ... + bn * xn

where:
- y is the dependent variable (target)
- b0 is the intercept (y-intercept) or the value of y when all predictors are 0
- b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients (slopes) that represent the effect of each predictor on the target variable
- x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables (predictors)

The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed target values and the predicted values from the linear equation.
Key concepts in linear regression include:
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method for finding the coefficients that minimize the error.
- Assumptions, such as linearity, independence of errors, constant variance (homoscedasticity), and normality of residuals.
- Evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess model performance.

Linear regression can be used for both simple (one predictor) and multiple (multiple predictors) linear regression tasks. It is often employed for predictive modeling, trend analysis, and identifying relationships between variables. While linear regression is a powerful and interpretable technique, it may not be suitable for complex relationships or non-linear data, which may require more sophisticated models.
## Polynomial Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression, also known as Polynomial Linear Regression, is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for modeling non-linear relationships between the dependent variable (target) and the independent variables (predictors). Instead of fitting a straight line, as in simple linear regression, polynomial regression fits a higher-degree polynomial curve to the data points.

The equation for polynomial regression takes the form:

y = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + ... + bn * x^n

where:
- y is the dependent variable (target)
- b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients representing the effect of each degree of the predictor on the target variable
- x is the independent variable (predictor)
- n is the degree of the polynomial curve (1 for linear regression, 2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic, and so on)

Polynomial regression allows the model to capture more complex patterns and non-linear relationships between variables, making it a more flexible regression technique. By increasing the degree of the polynomial, the model can fit more intricate curves to the data. However, caution must be exercised as high-degree polynomials can lead to overfitting, where the model fits noise and random variations in the data rather than the underlying pattern.

The process of polynomial regression involves selecting an appropriate degree of the polynomial, fitting the curve to the data using regression techniques (e.g., Ordinary Least Squares), and evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

Polynomial regression is commonly used when the data shows a curvilinear relationship between variables, and simple linear regression is not sufficient to capture the underlying pattern. It provides a more flexible approach to modeling complex data relationships, but careful consideration of the degree of the polynomial and potential overfitting is necessary to build an accurate and reliable model.
## Regression Matrices
Regression matrices, also known as coefficient matrices, are used in linear regression to summarize the relationship between the dependent variable (target) and the independent variables (predictors). They provide a concise representation of the coefficients (slopes) and the intercept (y-intercept) of the linear equation used to model the data.

In simple linear regression with one predictor variable (x) and one dependent variable (y), the regression equation takes the form:

y = b0 + b1 * x

where:
- y is the dependent variable (target)
- b0 is the intercept (y-intercept) or the value of y when x is 0
- b1 is the coefficient (slope) representing the effect of x on y

In multiple linear regression with multiple predictor variables (x1, x2, ..., xn) and one dependent variable (y), the regression equation becomes:

y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + ... + bn * xn

where:
- y is the dependent variable (target)
- b0 is the intercept (y-intercept) or the value of y when all predictors are 0
- b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients (slopes) representing the effect of each predictor on the target variable
- x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables (predictors)

The regression matrices represent these coefficients in a structured format, making it easier to interpret and analyze the model. In simple linear regression, the coefficient matrix is [b0, b1], and in multiple linear regression, the coefficient matrix is [b0, b1, b2, ..., bn].

These regression matrices are crucial in understanding the relationship between variables and making predictions based on the model. They provide valuable insights into the magnitude and direction of the impact of each predictor on the dependent variable, helping data scientists and analysts draw meaningful conclusions from their regression models.
# Week 11 (Classification Analysis)
## Binary Classification with Metrics:
Binary classification is a type of machine learning task where the goal is to classify data into one of two distinct classes or categories. Common metrics used to evaluate binary classification models include accuracy, which measures the overall correctness of predictions, precision, which quantifies the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, recall (sensitivity), which represents the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances, F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC), which visualize the model's trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.

## Multiclass Classification on IRIS:
Multiclass classification involves categorizing data into more than two classes. An example is the IRIS dataset, where the goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. Popular algorithms for multiclass classification include logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are used to assess the model's ability to correctly classify instances into multiple classes.

## Multiclass Classification on MNIST (Image Dataset):
Multiclass classification tasks on datasets like MNIST involve classifying images into multiple categories, each corresponding to a different digit (0 to 9). Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for image classification tasks. In addition to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, other metrics like top-1 and top-5 accuracy, which measure the percentage of correct predictions in the top-1 and top-5 ranked classes, are utilized to evaluate the performance of multiclass image classification models. The cross-entropy loss function is commonly used during training, aiming to minimize the dissimilarity between predicted and true class probabilities for each image.

# Week 12 (Decision Tree and Random Forest)
## Decision Trees:
Decision Trees are a popular and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They represent a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a specific feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the final classification or regression result. Decision Trees recursively split the data based on the features that best separate the data points into different classes or groups. The algorithm selects the optimal feature and split point by maximizing information gain or minimizing impurity measures like Gini impurity or entropy. Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making them valuable for understanding the decision-making process in complex data scenarios.

## Random Forest:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees to create a more robust and accurate model. It builds a collection of Decision Trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of features. The predictions of individual trees are then combined through voting (for classification tasks) or averaging (for regression tasks) to make the final prediction. Random Forests are less prone to overfitting compared to single Decision Trees, as the aggregation of multiple trees helps to reduce variance and improve generalization. They are widely used for various tasks, including classification, regression, and feature importance analysis.

## Random Forest Notebook:
A Random Forest notebook is a data science notebook, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, that contains code and explanations to implement and explore the Random Forest algorithm. It typically includes importing necessary libraries, loading data, preprocessing steps, building a Random Forest model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results. The notebook may also demonstrate how to tune hyperparameters and handle feature importance analysis, making it a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing Random Forests effectively in different machine learning projects.

## Feature Importance:
Feature Importance is a concept in machine learning that quantifies the influence of each feature (predictor) in the model's decision-making process. For Decision Trees and Random Forests, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much each feature contributes to reducing impurity in the tree-based models. Features that consistently lead to significant reductions in impurity during the tree building process are considered more important. Feature Importance analysis is valuable for understanding which features have the most impact on the target variable, aiding feature selection, and gaining insights into the underlying data relationships. It helps identify key factors driving predictions and assists in feature engineering, model optimization, and decision-making processes.

# Week 13(Unsupervised Learning : Clustering Analysis)
## Clustering:
Clustering is a machine learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together into clusters based on their similarities or distances from each other in a given dataset. The objective of clustering is to discover inherent patterns or structures in the data without using predefined labels. It is an unsupervised learning approach, meaning the algorithm does not rely on any labeled target variable for training. Instead, it seeks to find natural divisions in the data, where points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters. Clustering is widely used in various applications, including customer segmentation, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression. The process of clustering typically involves selecting an appropriate distance metric, choosing the number of clusters, and applying algorithms like K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, or Density-based Clustering to group the data points effectively. Clustering helps uncover valuable insights and structure in large datasets, aiding in data exploration and pattern recognition tasks.
## K-means:
K-means is a popular and widely used clustering algorithm in machine learning. It is an unsupervised learning technique used to partition data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The goal of the K-means algorithm is to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their corresponding cluster centroids, ensuring that points within the same cluster are similar to each other and points in different clusters are dissimilar.

The K-means algorithm works as follows:

1. ### Initialization:
Choose K initial cluster centroids randomly or based on some heuristic.

2. ### Assignment:
3.  Assign each data point to the nearest centroid (cluster) based on Euclidean distance or other distance metrics.

4. ### Update:
   Recalculate the centroids of each cluster by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to that cluster.

6. ### Repeat:
    Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

K-means converges to a solution where the centroids represent the center of the clusters, and the data points are optimally partitioned into K distinct groups.

However, it's essential to note that K-means may converge to local optima, meaning the resulting clusters might not be the globally optimal solution. To mitigate this issue, K-means is often run multiple times with different initial centroids, and the best result is selected based on a defined evaluation metric.

K-means is computationally efficient and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for clustering tasks, particularly when the number of clusters is known in advance. However, one limitation of K-means is that it assumes spherical clusters with similar variance, which may not always be suitable for all types of data distributions. Variants of K-means, such as K-means++, can be used to improve the selection of initial centroids and enhance the performance of the algorithm.

# Week 14 (Unsupervised Learning : Dimensionality Reduction)
## Dimensionality Reduction:
Dimensionality reduction is a crucial technique in data preprocessing and analysis that aims to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while preserving the essential information. In high-dimensional datasets, where the number of features is large, dimensionality reduction becomes necessary to overcome the curse of dimensionality, which can lead to increased computational complexity and overfitting in machine learning models. The goal of dimensionality reduction is to simplify the data representation by transforming it into a lower-dimensional space, capturing the most relevant patterns and relationships between variables.

There are two main approaches to dimensionality reduction: feature selection and feature extraction. Feature selection involves choosing a subset of the original features based on their relevance and importance to the target variable. This method discards irrelevant or redundant features, reducing the dataset's dimensionality. On the other hand, feature extraction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), create new synthetic features that are combinations of the original features. These new features, called principal components or embeddings, retain most of the variance in the data, making them more informative for downstream tasks like visualization, clustering, or classification.

Dimensionality reduction not only simplifies data visualization and interpretation but also helps in improving model performance by reducing noise and removing multicollinearity between features. However, it is essential to strike a balance between dimensionality reduction and the amount of information preserved to ensure that the transformed data still captures the critical characteristics of the original dataset.
# Week 15 (Big Dagta and Databases for Data Science)
## SQL for DataScience
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool in data science for querying, manipulating, and analyzing relational databases. It allows data scientists to retrieve specific data, perform data transformations, and generate insights from large datasets efficiently. Here's an example of SQL code for a simple data analysis task:
Assume we have a database table named "sales_data" with the following columns: "order_id," "customer_id," "product_id," "quantity," and "order_date."
1. ### Retrieve Data:
To retrieve data from the "sales_data" table, we can use the SELECT statement:
### Code:
SELECT *
FROM sales_data
LIMIT 10;
This code will fetch the first 10 rows from the "sales_data" table, displaying all columns.

2. ### Filter Data:
To filter the data based on specific conditions, we can use the WHERE clause:
### Code:
SELECT *
FROM sales_data
WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01' AND order_date <= '2023-03-31';
This code will retrieve all rows from the "sales_data" table where the "order_date" falls within the specified date range.

3. ### Aggregate Data:
To perform aggregation operations like sum, average, or count, we can use functions along with the GROUP BY clause:
### Code:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id;
This code will calculate the total quantity of products purchased by each customer and display the results.

4. ### Join Tables:
To combine data from multiple tables, we can use the JOIN clause:
SELECT customer_id, product_name, quantity
FROM sales_data
JOIN products ON sales_data.product_id = products.product_id;
This code will retrieve data from both the "sales_data" and "products" tables based on the matching "product_id" column.

## Big Data and DataScience
### Big Data:
Big Data refers to the massive volume of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data that is too large and complex to be processed and analyzed using traditional data processing techniques. Big Data is characterized by the 3Vs: Volume (huge amounts of data), Velocity (high speed at which data is generated and processed), and Variety (data comes in various formats and from diverse sources). Big Data often involves large-scale distributed computing and storage systems to handle and process data efficiently. Technologies like Hadoop and Spark are commonly used for managing and analyzing Big Data. The main challenge with Big Data is to store, process, and extract meaningful insights from the vast amount of information available.

### Data Science:
Data Science, on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary field that involves extracting knowledge and insights from data using scientific methods, algorithms, and processes. Data Science encompasses a wide range of techniques, including data cleaning, data integration, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Data scientists use their expertise in programming, mathematics, and domain knowledge to collect, process, and analyze data to discover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. Data Science aims to solve complex problems, make data-driven decisions, and build predictive models to gain valuable business or research insights. Data Science can be applied to various domains, including business, healthcare, finance, marketing, and many others.
